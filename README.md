# fingerprint_security_system

This project is a simple Fingerprint Security System.
Its purpose is to protect a lock (it could be a safe, door, cabinet etc.) from intruders by integrating a fingerprint sensor, solenoid door lock, motion sensor and buzzer which when all put together, serves as a secure security and alarm system. It provides only the user access as well as alarms them when there is an intruder close by. The microcontroller chosen is the Arduino DUE. This project involves various techniques and principles such as electromagnetism which allows the solenoid
door lock to operate, infrared technology which the PIR motion sensor operates on, Adafruit Fingerprint Library for the fingerprint sensor and State change detection for the push button. This project can and will be further improved. One possibility is the addition of a wireless communication or Bluetooth module to the system. With such an addition, the user may be able to receive text messages, emails or even tweets when the motion sensor detects an intruder.
